# Bikes Front-end Application
## Assumptions
* React and Redux were the desired stack
* The use case would not be requiring mobile-first design
* I am not expected to spend much time on this task
* I absolutely would have used TDD if not for code reuse regardless of "time saved" by not
## Discussion
The very first thing I did was to identify this task as very similar to one I have completed in React and Redux before. However, I hadn't visited that codebase in quite a while, so I've updated it to more modern practises in this rendition. My strong suit is not design, and since it wasn't developed with a design spec in mind, do not judge too harshly.
